## What I Learned

I created this project to improve my codding skills:
* Working with WPF, creating custom interface elements in XAML.
* Managing a database (SQLite). Writing SQL queries to create, delete, update, filter and sort data.
* Working with Microsoft Word documents using Open XML framework to create reports.
* Using the Nuget package manager.
